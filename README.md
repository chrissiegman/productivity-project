**(UNDER CONSTRUCTION)** - [The Productivity Project](https://productivity-project.herokuapp.com)

This is a suite of productivity tools built with Ruby on Rails.

I decided to build this application to increase my productivity and more closely track
how much time I was spending on specific projects.

**Planned Functionality:**
  1. Each user can create a list of current projects with a description, notes, links, etc.
  2. Users can "clock-in" and "clock-out" of a specific project to track the amount of time spent on it.
  3. Users can access data visualization tools to see how much time has been spent on each project relative to
      others, how their time was spent among projects by week or month, etc.  
  4. Users can collaborate on shared projects with other users
