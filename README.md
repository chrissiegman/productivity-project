**(UNDER CONSTRUCTION)**

This is a suite of productivity tools built with Ruby on Rails.

I decided to build this application to increase my productivity and more closely track
how much time I was spending on specific projects.

**Planned Functionality:**
  1. create a list of projects they are working on with a description, notes, links, etc.
  2. "clock-in" and "clock-out" of a specific project to track the amount of time they spend on it.
  3. access data visualization tools to see how much time they have spent on each project relative to
    others, how their time was spent among projects by week or month, etc.
  4. collaborate on shared projects with other users
